# Blackjack-Casino-Game

This project is a simple command-line Blackjack Casino Game implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The game simulates a basic version of Blackjack where a single player competes against a computer-controlled dealer.

- Single Player Mode: The player faces off against a dealer in a one-on-one Blackjack game.
- Deck of 52 Cards: A standard deck, containing 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs) with 13 cards in each.
  
### Game Mechanics:

1. Cards are dealt alternately from a shuffled deck.
2. The player can either "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (stop drawing).
3. A player can win by reaching 21 points (Blackjack) or having a score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21.
4. Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are valued at 10 points, and other cards are valued by their face value.
5. Dealer Strategy: The dealer will stand if their score reaches or exceeds 17.
